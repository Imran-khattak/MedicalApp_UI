# MedicalApp_UI

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

apps also offer telemedicine services that allow users to connect with healthcare providers remotely for consultations or remote monitoring. The goal of a medical health care app is to make it easier for individuals to take control of their health and improve their well-being.
